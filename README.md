# capstone_project_Movie gross predicting model

In the competitive world of film production, predicting a movieâ€™s revenue (gross) before its release is a challenge yet a necessity. It allows stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, distribution plans, and other critical aspects. This project embarks on an in-depth analysis of various features that might impact a movie's revenue, with the ultimate goal of developing a robust predictive model. This model aims to estimate the revenue of movies based on features such as budget, genre, production companies, and countries, runtime, year etc.
